# SLCalc: Slow Light Calculator

The goal of SLCalc is to describe the electrodynamics of superconducting circuits with (a) very high kinetic inductance and (b) size small compared to the Pearl length. Our key insight is that the speed of light in the dielectric environment is much higher than in the superconducting circuits. In other words, the electric fields in the dielectric environment adjusts to the motion of charges in the superconductor almost instantaneously. We, therefore, make the adiabatic approximation that the electric fields in the dielectric environment are prescribed by electrostatics. Additionally, the small size of the device as compared to the Pearl length allows us to ignore magnetic fields generated by supercurrents within the device. Using these approximations we can integrate out the electric fields in the 3D space and directly obtain equations of motion for the superconducting phase in the device. Because we are describing the slow propagation of light on superconducting circuits we call the resulting method the Slow Light Calculator (SLCalc). The initial version of SLCalc was implemented by Zhuan Li. It is limited to analyzing eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of 2D co-planar supercondcuting microwave devices.
